## Setup

To set up the environment, create a conda environment

```bash
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/yzshi5/FLAPS.git
cd FLAPS

# create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the `flaps` environment
conda activate flaps
```

Some MINO/weather experiments also require the MINO model utilities included in this repo.

## Datasets and Checkpoints 


Checkpoints and small prepared datasets are stored on Hugging Face

[FLAPS checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/Yaozhong/FLAPS)

```text
https://huggingface.co/Yaozhong/FLAPS
```
The scripts expect checkpoints and small prepared test datasets under the repository tree, for example:

```text
PDE_inverse/checkpoints/
PDE_inverse/datasets/
Regression/checkpoints/FLAPS_prior/
```

Download the uploaded artifacts from Hugging Face:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

snapshot_download(
    repo_id="Yaozhong/FLAPS",
    repo_type="model",
    local_dir=".",
    allow_patterns=[
        "config.json",
        "PDE_inverse/checkpoints/**",
        "PDE_inverse/datasets/**",
        "Regression/checkpoints/FLAPS_prior/GP_gibbs_epoch_500.pt",
        "Regression/checkpoints/FLAPS_prior/GP_matern_epoch_500.pt",
    ],
)
PY
```
You can also manually download the entire huggingface repo if you want. 

For the original PDE train/test data, you can also use:

```bash
cd PDE_inverse
python datasets/download_dataset.py all --output-dir datasets/PDE_inverse
```

The helper Python files for downloading and preprocessing the full PDE datasets are also available under:

```text
https://huggingface.co/Yaozhong/FLAPS/tree/main/PDE_inverse/datasets
```

After downloading the Hugging Face Arrow shards, convert them to `.npy` files with:

```bash
python datasets/inital_process.py \
  --input-root datasets/PDE_inverse \
  --output-root datasets/PDE_inverse_npy
```

To download test files only:

```bash
python datasets/download_dataset.py all --test --output-dir datasets/PDE_inverse
```

The functional regression dataest is based on https://github.com/yzshi5/MINO

The PDE inverse datasets are provided by : https://github.com/jhhuangchloe/DiffusionPDE and https://github.com/neuraloperator/FunDPS

## Quick Test 

To reproduce the results of GP regression, first download the checkpoint for the prior ``Regression/checkpoints/FLAPS_prior/GP_matern_epoch_500.p`` 

place it under ``Regression`` folder, then run : 

```bash
cd Regression
bash scripts/eval_GP_matern_reg.sh
```

To reproduce the results of Darcy Flow PDE inverse with FNO prior (used for OFM), first download checkpoints for prior and PDE surrogate 

``PDE_inverse/checkpoints/FLAPS_prior/FNO/darcy_fno_prior_100.pt`` 

``PDE_inverse/checkpoints/PDE_surrogate/darcy_forward.pt``  

Then download the small prepared test dataset. 

``PDE_inverse/checkpoints/datasets/darcy/darcy_pde_test_200.npy``

Finally run: 

```bash
cd PDE_inverse
bash scripts/eval_darcy_inverse.sh
```

To apply FLAPS for finite-dimensional Flow Matching prior (UNet prior), download the UNet prior and then run 

```bash
cd PDE_inverse
bash scripts/eval_darcy_inverse_unet.sh
```

We also provide checkpoints for other PDE inverse problem, repeat the above steps to run on different PDE inverse problem

## Run FLAPS for Functional Regression 

To run FLAPS for functional regression, we just need to train a prior. Let's take GP matern case as an example

```bash
cd Regression
```

Train priors:

```bash
bash scripts/train_GP_matern_prior.sh
```

Evaluate regression tasks:

```bash
bash scripts/eval_GP_matern_reg.sh
```


## Run FLAPS for PDE Inverse 


All commands below are run from:

```bash
cd PDE_inverse
```
PDE inverse outputs are written under:

```text
PDE_inverse/outputs/
```

In the following steps, we take Darcy Flow PDE inverse problem as an example. The pipeline is the same for other PDE problem. 

#### 1. Train and evaluate FNO Forward Surrogates
The first step is to train the FNO forward surrogate, you can also replace FNO with other PDE surrogate, like Transolver, GAOT etc or just a differentiable PDE solver 

```bash
bash scripts_surrogate/train_darcy_FNO.sh
bash scripts_surrogate/eval_darcy_FNO.sh
```

#### 2. Train FLAPS Priors
After we get the trained forward surrogate, we can train the Flow Matching priors for FLAPS. In this study, we test both function-space prior (FNO prior) and standard finite-dimensional prior (UNet prior). The results show the backward compatibility of FLAPS

```bash
bash scripts/train_darcy_prior.sh
bash scripts/train_darcy_prior_unet.sh
```
#### 3. Run Inverse Evaluation

Then run single-case evaluation with FNO or UNet prior 

```bash
bash scripts/eval_darcy_inverse.sh
bash scripts/eval_darcy_inverse_unet.sh
```

When use FNO prior, the entire formulation is built on function space, we can do zero-shot inference for PDE inverse problem. Darcy super-resolution inverse evaluation:

```bash
bash scripts/eval_darcy_inverse_sup.sh
```
#### 4. Reproduce the reported performance 

We need to run FLAPS over entire test datasets, each test dataset in the paper contains 100 test cases. 

```bash
bash scripts_metrics/eval_darcy_inverse_all_test.sh
bash scripts_metrics/eval_darcy_inverse_all_test_unet.sh
```



## Comments 
- A paradigm shift from Neural Processes, a principled Bayesian framework for general stochastic process regression. 
- FLAPS is a generic posterior sampling algorithm for both function-space and finite-dimensional (standard) flow matching prior. We recommend using U-Net based prior (by default) if the resolution is fixed.
- With dense observations, you can set rank=0 to inject white noise during Langevin steps. (UNet prior is recommended)
- When use differential PDE solver as the surrogate, which is sensitive to initialization, FLAPS is much more stable than Diffusion-based posterior sampling method.

## Notes
- Check shell scripts before long runs; they set GPU devices, checkpoint names, and dataset paths.
- Checkpoints and datasets are intentionally ignored by Git and should be downloaded from Hugging Face.
- FLAPS is robust to a very wide range of hyperparameters, the same configuration can be used for different setting
